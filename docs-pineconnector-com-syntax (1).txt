Alert Message Guidelines

eaoff

To create PineConnector-compliant alert messages, please pay attention to the

eaon

following guidelines. Failure to adhere to the syntax may result in the EA rejecting

closeall

your signal.

closealleaoff
closelong

Test Drive Before Going Live
Before creating actual alerts for your strategy, we recommend sending
manual or test alerts to ensure the following:
1. The alert message configured on TradingView is valid, as per the Syntax
Guide.

closeshort
closelongshort
closelongbuy
closeshortsell

2. The selected EA Settings result in the intended behavior.

Checking for Successful Signals
If you don't see signals appearing on your MetaTrader terminal, you can check
the Signals Log in your members portal.

Components
There are four components in alert messages, namely:

Component

License ID

Commands

Echo
Instances & Licenses

Symbol

Others

This is a unique identifier found in the Licensing Dashboard.
It is a long value that usually starts with a 6 or 7, such as 70123456789.
These are actions like "buy," "sell," etc.
Please note that commands do not have an equal (=) sign.
This refers to the asset or instrument to be traded.
These are additional components that use the equal (=) sign, such as
"risk=".

Examples
We have 3 open long positions, totalling 3.5 lots, arranged by the time they
were opened:
Position A: Buy 1 lot (opened first)
Position B: Buy 2 lots (opened second)
Position C: Buy 0.5 lots (opened last)

1. Partial Closure Across Multiple Positions
Command: closelongvol with risk=2.8
Result:
Position A will close fully from 1 lot to 0 lots.
Position B will close 1.8 lots, leaving 0.2 lots remaining.
Position C remains unaffected with 0.5 lots.
2. Closing More Than the Total Volume
Command: closelongvol with risk=4
Result:
Position A will close fully from 1 lot to 0 lots.
Position B will close fully from 2 lots to 0 lots.
Position C will close fully from 0.5 lots to 0 lots.
Note: The total volume to close (4) exceeds the open positions (3.5),
so all positions are closed.
3. Closing Less Than the Smallest Position
Command: closelongvol with risk=0.4
Result:

Position A will close 0.4 lots, leaving 0.6 lots remaining.
Position B remains unaffected with 2 lots.

LicenseID,newsltpselllimit,EURUSD,sl=30,tp=60

Breakeven
The breakeven point is when your stop loss (SL) is set at your entry price, meaning if
the SL is hit, there will be no losses.

Instead of using the breakeven feature, which requires determining breakeven
at the point of entry, you can use newsltplong or newsltpshort with sl=0
to trigger the SL adjustment to breakeven at a later stage.
Automatically move the SL of the position to breakeven when betrigger= is
satisfied
Ensure that beoffset < betrigger

betrigger=
Breakeven will be activated after the position gains this number of pips.
Ensure > 0

beoffset=
Offset from entry price.
0 means the SL will be placed exactly at entry price.
1 means 1 pip above the entry price for buy trades and 1 pip below for sell trades.
this is the amount of pips you'd like to protect.

LicenseID,buy,EURUSD,risk=1,sl=20,betrigger=10,beoffset=2

Ensure that the 2 parameters “betrigger=” and “beoffset=” are present in your
syntax.

Interpretation
Buy 1 lot of EURUSD with SL 20 pips away from market price
Breakeven feature to trigger after price moves 10 favourable pips and SL to be
placed 2 pips above entry price

Pip Trailing
Automatically moves SL with the direction of the trade (up for longs, and down

for shorts)
All trailing parameters are restricted to integers — floats will be rounded to the
nearest integer
Trailing computation will be based on pips, regardless of the Target Type
selected

Spelling Bee
Please check that you spell “trailing” correctly in your syntax. Some users
faced syntax issues as they spelled it as “trialing”.

trailtrig=
Trailing stop-loss will be activated after a trade gains this number of pips.

traildist=
Distance of the trailing stop-loss from current price.
SL will be opened at traildist after trailtrig is met, even if you do not have a SL placed.

trailstep=
Moves trailing stop-loss once price moves to favourable by a specified number of
pips.

LicenseID,buy,EURUSD,risk=1,trailtrig=12,traildist=8,trailstep=3

Ensure that the 3 parameters “trailtrig=”, “traildist=” and “trailstep=” are present in
your syntax.

Interpretation
With trailtrig=12, the first instance of trailing SL will be when price moves
favourably for 12 pips (entry+12).
The SL will be placed 8 pips lower at (entry+12-8).
If you have a SL, the SL will be updated
If you do not have a SL, a SL will be created for you
With trailstep=3, the second instance of trailing SL is when price moves
favourably for another 3 pips (entry+12+3).
The SL will be placed at 8 pips lower at (entry+12+3-8).
The third instance will be when price moves another 3 favourable
pips (entry+12+3+3)
The SL will be placed 8 pips lower at (entry+12+3+3-8), and so on.

Negative “trailtrig=”
You can use a negative 'trailtrig=' value to ensure immediate activation of the
trailing feature. If you use 'trailtrig=0', the pip-trailing might only begin after the
spread in pips.
For example, you could use :
trailtrig=-10,traildist=12,trailstep=1'
With this configuration, the Expert Advisor (EA) will start pip-trailing
immediately. The Stop Loss (SL) will be adjusted every 10 pips from the market
price, and the SL will be moved every 1 pip in case of favorable movement.

When trading non-FX, such as the US100, using a value of 10 may mean 1
point in the index. Do test it first and refer to the Experts Tab — the EA will
print trailing information such as the price where the trailing feature will begin

ATR Trailing
Please note that ATR Trailing is based on MetaTrader prices, not TradingView.
As a result, minor discrepancies may occur.
Instead of your SL trailing based on pips, your SL trails based on the ATR
computed
Only atrtimeframe= and atrperiod= are mandatory — other parameters are
optional

atrtimeframe=
ATR Trailing Stop will be based on the specified timeframe in minutes and will only
update once per bar close.
If stop loss not specified at the point of entry, a SL will be automatically added with
the ATR values used.

Allowable timeframe values for MT4:
1. 1 (1 minute),
2. 5 (5 minutes),
3. 15 (15 minutes),
4. 30 (30 minutes),
5. 60 (1 hour),
6. 240 (4 hours),
7. 1440 (1 day)

MT5 Allowable Timeframes
On MetaTrader 5, there are no limits to the allowable timeframe. You may
input any timeframe value you prefer such as “atrtimeframe=10”.

atrperiod=
ATR averaging period

atrmultiplier=
Multiple of ATR to utilise in the new SL computation.
Default = 1

atrshift=
Relative shift of price information, 0 uses latest candle, 1 uses second last, etc.
Default: 0

atrtrigger=
Activate the trigger of ATR Trailing after market moves favourably by a number of
pips.
Default: 0 (instantaneous)

LicenseID,buy,EURUSD,risk=1,sl=10,
atrtimeframe=60,atrperiod=14,atrmultiplier=2,atrtrigger=8

Ensure that at the 2 parameters “atrtimeframe=” and “atrperiod=” are present in your
syntax. Other components are optional where they will use the default values as
stated above.

Interpretation
Buy EURUSD at the market with SL placed 10 pips away
ATR Trailing will begin after 8 pips of favorable move
ATR is computed using the average of the previous 14 60-min candles,
multiplied by 2.

Filters
spread=
Enter the position only if the spread is equal or less than the specified value in pips.

LicenseID,buy,EURUSD,risk=1,spread=2

Interpretation
If Account Balance is $500 or higher, process buy signal
If Account Balance is less than $500, ignore buy signal

Miscellaneous
secret=
Include this parameter to authenticate the signal with a specific secure key.

You will only need to specify a secret key if you have Signal Authentication turned
“On”.

LicenseID,buy,EURUSD,risk=1,secret=SECRETKEY

Self-Defined Secret Key
The signal will only be relayed to your MetaTrader terminal if the provided
secret key matches the secret key input in the PineConnector Portal.

Position A will close 0.4 lots, leaving 0.6 lots remaining.
Position B remains unaffected with 2 lots.
Position C remains unaffected with 0.5 lots.
1. Scenario D: Closing Exactly the Total Volume of Positions
Command: closelongvol with risk=3.5
Result:
Position A will close fully from 1 lot to 0 lots.
Position B will close fully from 2 lots to 0 lots.
Position C will close fully from 0.5 lots to 0 lots.
Note: The total volume to close matches the sum of all open positions, resulting in complete closure of all positions.
